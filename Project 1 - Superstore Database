#For this project, I used SQL to query the Superstore database to get information about items sold at the store and their prices.

-- #1 get column names
SELECT *
FROM superstore
LIMIT 5
;
-- GENERAL STATISTICS ON ENTIRE INVENTORY --
-- #2 query to list and order by price
SELECT item_name, price
FROM superstore
ORDER BY price DESC
;
-- #3 query to show how many different items in the database
SELECT COUNT (item_name)
FROM superstore
;
-- #4 query to show how many different categories in the database
SELECT COUNT (category)
FROM superstore
;
-- #5 query to show how many item types are in each category
SELECT COUNT (item_name), category
FROM superstore
GROUP BY category
;
-- #6 query to show average rating per category type
SELECT AVG (average_rating), category
FROM superstore
GROUP BY category
ORDER BY AVG (average_rating)
;
-- #7 query to show average price per category type
SELECT AVG (price), category
FROM superstore
GROUP BY category
ORDER BY AVG (price)
;
-- STATISTICS ON kitchen supplies --
-- #8 Calculate total stock in kitchen supplies
SELECT SUM (stock_quantity) 
FROM superstore
WHERE category = "Kitchen Supplies"
;
-- #9 Calculate the average cost of kitchen supply items
SELECT AVG (price) 
FROM superstore
WHERE category = "Kitchen Supplies"
;
-- #10 Calculate the average RATING of kitchen supply items
SELECT AVG (average_rating) 
FROM superstore
WHERE category = "Kitchen Supplies"
;
-- #11 Calculate how many air purifiers are in stock
SELECT stock_quantity
FROM superstore
WHERE item_name = "Air Purifier"
;
